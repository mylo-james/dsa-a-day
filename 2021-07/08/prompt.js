Given a string s, find the length of the longest 
substring without repeating characters.

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

Input: s = ""
Output: 0

console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstring('abcabcbb'));
console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstring('bbbbb'));
console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstring('pwwkew'));
console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstring(''));
*/

const lengthOfLongestSubstring = function (s) {
};
