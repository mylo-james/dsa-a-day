Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same 
backward as forward. 
For example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not.

Input: x = 121
Output: true

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. 
From right to left, it becomes 121-. 
Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Follow up: Could you solve it without 
converting the integer to a string?
